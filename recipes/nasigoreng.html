        <h3>Tips</h3>
            <p>To cook rice: Bring 2 cups of water and 1 cup white rice to a boil in a saucepan over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until rice is tender and liquid is absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes. Spread onto a baking sheet, then refrigerate until cold, about 2 hours.</p>
